      Shippori Mincho is a family intended for novel writers who are looking for a beautiful and
      free Mincho style family. It is based on The Tokyo Tsukiji Type Foundry No. 5 Mincho style,
      which has had a great influence on the style itself. The Regular was originally designed for
      long-form text setting in novels and the ExtraBold was originally designed for titles and
      headlines. Eventually, it became a family of 5 weights.
